# Vyathan.com Company Portfolio Website

## CPGM 132 - Introduction to HTML

My plan is to build a static website to replace the one currently on vyathan.com. Since I've already built many I want to do this site differently. This time I want to change the filenames when the site is diplayed and I want to build a calendar API after I complete the assignment.

The site will be laid out with four pages, Home, About, Services, and Contact.

The homepage will be pretty standard. Basic landing page info.

On the About page I want to introduce the team and in an effort to challenge myself I'd like to try and build a carosel for team members to be displayed on mobile.

Services will be rather straightforward as well.

On the Contact page I think I'd like to record a video to play and introduce myself to prospective clients giving the site a bit more personal feel.

I'm going to use AWS S3 to stand up this new website.

I'm also going to try and make the new site contain all of the following (Last Year's Class Requirements):

Basic HTML elements and style:

a) Doctype

b) Header Information

c) Metadata

d) Styles

e) Orderered or Unordered lists

f) Hypertext links

h) Images

Create a CSS set of formatting standards

Utilize a page layout including:

a) Header with navigation bar

b) Body content with two columns

c) Collapsible footer

Graphical elements:

a) Use of enhancements such as shadows/gradients

Including a table or column

Including a web form with the following:

a) Text area

b) Labels/Input box

c) Drop-down list

d) Selection list

e) Radio button

f) Submit/Reset button

Incorporating a multimedia element

Including a current date/time element using JavaScript
